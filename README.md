Bio Data Manager is a Python project designed for managing and processing, bio-sequence data (DNA, PROTEINS, SMILES).<br>
This allows an easy encoding of sequences into tensors that can be then used for AI computation and complex models implementations.

## Project Structure
- `bio_data_manager/`: Contains core modules for bioinformatics sequence processing and management.
- `bio_sequences/`: Handles various operations related to biological sequences such as DNA and protein.


## Usage
1. Install it as a library 
   ```bash
   pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/fabiobove-dr/bio_data_manager.git@0.0.1
   ```
2. Examples of the code can be found in the `usage_examples.py` file.
